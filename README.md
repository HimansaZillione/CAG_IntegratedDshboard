1. Always maintain a remote branch for your individual work.
2. From your local branch publish the changes to your remote branch, From there merge the changes with the Main/Master branch.

4. Before publishing changes from your local branch==> to your remote branch, FETCH the latest version of the working project from the MASTER branch.
